# DeterKnock


Stop knocking on my door when im doing something important!

The goal is to convey to people coming up to my door that I am in a meeting or something, so they don't start banging away.

The apparatus is an ESP8266 connected to a 16 by 2 LCD with an RGB LED controlled by an android app to convey the status of my being.
